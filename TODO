Make retryable accept a string to log, it logs it with a retry count.
Factor into modules.
Store all scripts in a single gigantic scripts.json file.
Remove vim-script.json from git repos.  Make them plain repos again.
Test by parsing webcache, not just converting scripts.
Get rid of 'scripts' database, everything is either in the webcache or scripts.json file.
Denormalize all author and script info into each version so that we
  can recreate the whole archive at any time.  No need for separate test branch.

Make more resilient against intermittent failures
(simple reload seems to fix it every time)
We should probably re-fetch the script at least once if hpricot dies with an error.

what happened to archive_viewer.vim and coding_style.vim and indentcpp.vim?
Make sure all these look OK:
delete mode 100644 1093 - archive_viewer.vim.json
delete mode 100644 2633 - coding_style.vim.json
delete mode 100644 2636 - indentcpp.vim.json

Check on AutoTmpl and AutoTmpl-B

Why doesn't Lite-Tab-Page exist on github???

Switch to Nokogiri, hpricot appears totally hopeless at charset issues.

Someone deleted everything and uploaded a vimball??  Need to suppress.

BufClose and bufkill?  Try to consolidate close buffer plugins.

fully automate scraping

is it possible to generate docs incrementally?  (n/a once the central db is done)

make it possible for 2 or more scrapers to work at the same time

https://github.com/vim-scripts/browserprint has a README.md file
which overrides our README file.  Maybe we should skip making our
own README if README.md already exists...?

unzip: probably not worth filing a bug on Infozip...  wish it could decompress newer zipfiles tho.

hpricot monkeypatch

... anything else?
