# Mass delete, just pass the names or full paths of the repos to delete
# and both the github and local repos/* repositories will be deleted.
#
##
# You might need to wait for a few hours between deleting and pushing
# since github has a bug where quickly deleting, creating, and pushing a
# repo with the same name will just result in a resurrection of the old
# repo with the old contents, not an empty one.
#
# Now you can use "FORCE=1 ./scraper 0999" to get around this.  It doesn't
# update the script's description but usually that's not needed and it's
# better than waiting for github to fix this bug!
